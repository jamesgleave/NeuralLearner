Improvements to Neural Learner


1) Node gene action objects

Instead of using an enum to determine which calculation method to use (for now we have lin comb and latch), we should have a calculation object which handles that generally.
With that object, instead of using a switch case, we can just call obj.calculate or something similar


2) Agent special abilities

A new feature to allow agents to get a random passive or active ability they can use (like boost or poison)


3) Improve the way the genes are handled

There are too many vars, maybe put into list?


4) Improve senses

The way senses work right now is not modular... How could we make it modular?
If I want to add more senses, I must add substantial code.
