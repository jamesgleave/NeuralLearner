Improvements to Neural Learner


1) Use shaders for the material of the agents?


2) Agent special abilities
A new feature to allow agents to get a random passive or active ability they can use (like boost or poison)


3) Improve the way the genes are handled
There are too many vars, maybe put into list?


4) Improve senses
The way senses work right now is not modular... How could we make it modular?
If I want to add more senses, I must add substantial code.

5) Give Agents Memory
Give agents memory in their senses. For example, based on the size of their brain, they may be able to remember things longer in their visual buffer.
Instead of clearing the visual buffer every time senses are collected, perhaps we can only update it instead.
If pellet P1 was seen, and then the agent gets turned around and does not see it anymore,
we can keep it for a certain number of steps or until it is over written.

Idea? The agent's memory is a function of its brain size. The agents memory value effects how long it can accurately remember something.
The longer the agent is not directly observing something, the more fuzzy (we add noise to the observation) the 'memory' becomes.
